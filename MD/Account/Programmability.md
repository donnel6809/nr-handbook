# New Relic Handbook

# New Relic Programmability
Programmability is one of New Relic's newest features. It allows you to build an application upon New Relic and interact with the data stored in your account in ways never thought possible before. 

We have made React.JS and GraphQL available as tools to utilise and offer you New Relic's platform to create a bespoke experience to meet your custom needs. 

## Workshops
If you're familiar with React and GraphQL this may be quite easy for you, but even if you are not, our workshops are very prescriptive, descriptive and help walk you through each step of building your own Nerdpack.

If you are interested in building your own applications on New Relic, the following labs presented as a workshop will aid you in starting your journey.
[New Relic One - Programmability Workshops](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop)

## NerdPack Manager
If you are not the Owner of a New Relic account, you can assume you do not have permission to publish and deploy applications to your account. You can still build and do locally running tests to showcase your idea, but putting your final project on New Relic will require additional permissions.

Please seek out the **Nerdpack** manager role from your account Owner or Admins. Once you have this role you will be able to follow the instructions to publish a nerdpack fully.

## Where Do I Start Once I Have Permission
Navigate to one.newrelic.com - This will allow you to see your entire New Relic world, allowing you to see entities from different accounts you may have permissions on, in one place. Here you will find a tile called **Build Your Own Application**

In here you can generate a development API key for your account, accept the T&C agreement, download the New Relic CLI and get started. You will be promted to 

## Is There Any Examples Of This?
Yes, New Relic has open sourced around 15 initially and more to be added in the coming weeks and months of internally built applications solving a specific need or use case or visualisation requirement.

You can check them out, download them and run them locally [via this link](https://developer.newrelic.com/open-source/nerdpacks)

Some of the more popular Nerdpacks are the 

Cloud Optimise (tries to find under used servers and make suggestions on GCP/AWS/Azure as to where savings could be made)
Status Page (which lets you define multiple status pages of tools you rely on to keep an eye on their current status)
Browser Analyser (breakdown your frontend data into Apdex groupings and analyse Bounce Rate impact of slower pages)
Groundskeeper (quickly identify old APM agents in your infrastructure). 

## But I'm Not That Technical. I don't enjoy command lines - Enter Application Catalog
Not everyone is a command line and SDK hero and New Relic recognises that. That's why we recently launched our Application Catalog. A collection of amazing open source application you can quickly and easily deploy to your account and gain value from without any specific technical knowledge.

Simply open the Application Catalog. Choose a provide app tile and click in for more information about what it could do for you. Once you know what one you would like to add. Simple click **Add This App** button top right of the app detail and then you can choose the accounts you are named on which you would like to add them to. SO SIMPLE.

**You Require the Nerdpack Manager Role to Add Nerdpacks to your account**

## How Do I Learn More?

New Relic has launched developer.newrelic.com with additional information and resources around building these apps on New Relic. 

We have guidance around how to use the CLI, we also have a section on API's and Components which allow you to interact with your New Relic data in a simple way via simple JSX elements.
