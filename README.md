# New Relic Handbook

_**New Relic Handbook, what is that?**_

The New Relic Handbook we have created here is a template for you to take, and change to suit your needs. The goal here is for you to have a quick-start guide for your internal teams when they start to work with New Relic. This covers things from agent configuration, to alert notification settings. The important bases to cover for new people starting with New Relic. 

As your business grows, your need for New Relic may grow too. New business units in your organisation will likely adopt New Relic and they may come to you for help. This Handbook is designed to allow you to support those teams in setting up New Relic quickly. 

Now this is not a complete guide, this instead is a starting point for you to take and build on. You are the New Relic Expert in your company and so you are the best help your teams could get, and building out your own handbook will help to reduce the pain points in getting set up quickly in the beginning. 

_**What do I do with the handbook?**_

The Handbook comes in both HTML & Markdown formats, you can take both, or pick your preferred option. From there you can host this internally at your organisation, adjust the details to suit your company standards on security (SSO/etc..), or on notification settings. Essentially this is yours to define your own rules with New Relic. 

Defining a user structure with Admins / Users / Add-on Roles all being set appropriately will help to ensure that the right New Relic users in your company will have the ability to do what they need in New Relic when they need to do it. 

You’ll notice that in this handbook we use Slack as an example for reaching out to your company’s New Relic experts. That is you. The people who look to New Relic APM every day to solve performance problems, to peek into important business metrics in Insights, to verify your hosts are performing at an optimal level with infrastructure. You know New Relic better than most, and because of that, you’ll likely be turned to when new business units need to be onboarded with New Relic. This handbook is there to simplify that for you.
